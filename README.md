# 💫 About Me

I'm a researcher and practitioner exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on **Large Language Models** and **AI agents**. Currently diving deep into the mechanics of how models learn and adapt through context.


## 🔬 Research Interests
- **In-Context Learning**: Investigating how LLMs acquire and utilize new information without parameter updates  
- **AI Agents**: Building autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and interact with complex environments  
- **Emergent Capabilities**: Understanding how sophisticated behaviors arise from scale and training  
- **Model Interpretability**: Uncovering the internal mechanisms that drive language model performance  

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Experimenting with novel prompting strategies and few-shot learning techniques  
- Developing AI agents that can adapt to dynamic environments and multi-step reasoning tasks  
- Exploring the intersection of retrieval-augmented generation and contextual learning  
- Contributing to open-source tools that advance AI research accessibility  

## 🛠️ Research Philosophy
I believe the next breakthrough in AI lies not just in scaling models, but in understanding how to make them more sample-efficient learners and more reliable reasoners. My work sits at the intersection of theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

*Always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with language models and intelligent agents.*
